# ITBC_project_zaklinabaleviC

This project contains manual testing, test automation and Postman API testing for the website https://demoqa.com/.

#Manual Testing 

In this part, I created a test plan for the website https://demoqa.com/. 
The test plan was written in an Excel sheet, outlining the test cases to be executed. I also included a section for logging any bugs or suggestions for improvements. 

#Automation

The project structure follows the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for better maintainability and readability. I used the following libraries and frameworks:

Selenium WebDriver: For interacting with the web elements on the website.
TestNG: To organize and execute the automated tests.

#API Testing 

For API testing, a Postman collection was created to test the endpoints of the https://demoqa.com/swagger/#/ API.
